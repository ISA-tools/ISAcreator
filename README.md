**Build dependencies:**
    These are all managed by Maven <http://maven.apache.org/>.

### Contributing

The main ISAcreator source tree is hosted on git (a popular [DVCS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_revision_control)), thus you should create a fork of the repository in which you perform development. See <http://help.github.com/forking/>.

We prefer that you send a [*pull request* here on GitHub](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/) which will then be merged into the official main line repository. You need to sign the ISAtools CLA to be able to contribute (see below).
